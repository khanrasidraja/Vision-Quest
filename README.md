## Overview
Vision-Quest is a JavaScript project scaffolded to help you move from idea to prototype quickly. Whether you’re experimenting with UIs, media inputs (camera/microphone), or just need a simple baseline to try new concepts, this repo gives you a lightweight, batteries-included starting point.

## Features
- Zero-friction JavaScript development flow
- Sensible defaults for local dev, build, and deployment
- Easily extensible structure for components, utilities, and assets
- Ready for adding your favorite tooling (bundler, linter, formatter, tests)

Tip: Update this section with concrete features as the project grows.

## Quickstart
```bash
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Start the dev server (replace with your actual dev command if different)
npm run dev

# 3) Open the app
# Visit the URL printed in your terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173 or http://localhost:3000)
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm 9+ (or yarn/pnpm if you prefer)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/khanrasidraja/Vision-Quest.git
cd Vision-Quest

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Start the development server (hot reload)
npm run dev
```
- If your dev server uses a specific port, document it here.
- If no dev server is set up yet, you can add one with your preferred bundler (Vite, Parcel, Webpack) and update these instructions.

### Build
```bash
# Create a production build
npm run build

# Preview the production build (if configured)
npm run preview
```
- Replace or remove commands above if your scripts differ.

## Configuration
If your project requires runtime environment variables, create a `.env` file at the root.

```bash
# Example (customize as needed)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
# Add any keys your app needs
```

Commit a safe template as `.env.example` and document each variable.

## Project Structure

Adjust this map to reflect the actual folders as the project evolves.

## Scripts
Document the scripts you support in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}
```
Customize to your toolchain (or add placeholders until scripts are defined).

## Roadmap
- [ ] Initialize bundler/tooling (Vite/Webpack/Parcel)
- [ ] Add linting/formatting (ESLint + Prettier)
- [ ] Set up unit tests (Vitest/Jest)
- [ ] Configure CI (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Create a basic UI shell and home page
- [ ] Add demo(s) and screenshots
- [ ] Publish a live demo
